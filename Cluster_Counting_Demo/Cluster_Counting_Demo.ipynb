    "In solid materials, often elements of the system can be heterogeneously distributed within the material.  One common example is an alloy, like CuAu, in which Cu and Au atoms are distributed on an FCC lattice.  Another common example that motivates the tools here are heteroatoms within a zeolite.  For instance, Al atoms within an otherwise Si rich lattice introduce reactivity into zeolites.  A zeolite may have more than one symmetry-distinct type of site that an host an Al, and one way of describing a particular zeolite would then be to count the fractional occupancy of Al within a given site type.  At a higher level, combinations of Al within a zeolite may be important to their properties and reactivity.  We seek here to develop a general tool that can identify the symmetry-distinct sites and their combinations on a general lattice (which we call \"clusters\"), that can populate these sites given a total composition of the system and some rules that govern site occupancies, that can count arbitrary clusters given site occupancies, and that can \"titrate,\" or count under the constraint that a given site can only be counted once.  \n",

ATAT determines the space group of the lattice, finds all symmetrically distinct clusters of the variable composition sites based on the space group, and outputs the details(such as multiplicity) for each cluster type.\n",

It also has the functions that create xyz files to represent different cluster types. \n",

The str.out file will be used with the lat.in file in the corrdump program to generate a full cluster list (cluster_list.csv) for the super cell. The Structure class also has the function which will read the cluster list file and store the coordinates for all the clusters in the super cell for each cluster type.

    "1. Lattice(primitive cell)  \n",
    "   Lattice is the smallest cell whose crystal structure is repeated in the space for the material. \n",
    "2. Structure  \n",
    "   Structure is the super cell, which contains one or multiple lattice celss. Its composition is repeated in the space for the material.\n",
    "3. Structure Vector(structure configuration)  \n",
    "   A structure vector is used to specify the structure configuration. It is a list consisting of 0s and 1s. Each number corresponds to one site in the structure super cell. The index of the number in the structure vector list is exactly the index of the correspondent site in the site dataframe, which is constructed to store the site information for all the sites in a structure and is defined in the initialization of a Structure class(details can be found in the software introduction). In the vector, 0 represents the 1st type of atom defined in the lattice file for that site and 1 represents the 2nd type of atom. For example, we have a structure vector of [0,1,1,0] and there are two types of elements for each sites, Si(represented as 0) or Al(represented as 1). This structure vector represents a structure with 4 sites. The first site has the 0th element, which is Si, the second site has the 1st element, which is Al, the third site has Al and the fourth site has Si.\n",
    "4. Cluster Type  \n",
    "  Here, we name the cluster types by two numbers by a hyphen. The first number represents the number of sites within the cluster, and the second number represents the order of the cluster type based on the maximum distance between 2 atoms within the cluster. For example, the cluster type of 2-1 for a specific lattice represents the two-body cluster with the shortest atom distance in that lattice.\n",
    "5. Count/Titration Results  \n",
    "  The count/titration results will be output in dictionaries. The dictionary stores the counting/titration results for the cluster types and the results can be achieved by the cluster type. For example:\n",
    "  {'2-1':10, '2-2':20} represents the counting/titration value for 2-1 cluster type is 10 and that for 2-2 cluster type is 20."

The object structure may contain one or multiple lattice cells and its composition is repeated in the space.  \n",

There are two types if indices, one is data index, which is the index for the site among all the sites within the dataframe; the other is site index, which is the index for the site among the same type of sites. The data index is just numbers and the site index is a combination of site type and numbers. For example, the first site in the dataframe has a data index of 0 and a site index of Si,Al-0 for chabazite. The indices depend on the order of the site in the lat.in file. \n",
