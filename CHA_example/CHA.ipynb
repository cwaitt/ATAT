Here we will refer the important groups of atoms as clusters. Given the bulk material property, such as the element ratio, we want to compute the distributions of the clusters in order to quantitatively understand the reactivity. The ultimate goal of this cluster counting module is to statistically compute the cluster distributions for different conditions, such as different crystal structures, different rules for atom locations, and different counting and titration priorities. This ultimate goal can be further divided into four specific goals. First, given a crystal structure, we want to understand the lattice and be able to identify distinct clusters. Next, we want to be able to count different type of clusters given a structure configuration (which specifies the atom type at each site). Thirdly, we would like to generate randome structure configurations for any given element ratio. Last, we want to titrate clusters one by one to avoid double counting clusters that share sites with each other."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5Vg0TEmdy3dj"},"source":["### Goal One - Identify Distinct Clusters (understand the lattice/structure)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8VHZU_g4y3dj"},"source":["Algorithm\n","\n","To understand the distribution of clusters, we first need to distinguish between different clusters. Clusters differ from each other based on atom distances and symmetries.\n","\n","To achieve this goal, we took advantage of the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) developed by Axel van de Walle. In ATAT, the corrdump program takes lattice parameters and site positions as input, determines the space group of the lattice, and find all symmetrically distinct clusters based on the space group. When analyzing distinct clusters, corrdump only count for sites which are possbile for at least two types of elements. The sites which can accommodate only one type of element will only help with analyzing symmetries. The installation and modification of ATAT can be found in supporting information."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ttzd2J8Zy3dk"},"source":["Input:\n","1. lat.in  \n","2. str_dim.txt"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NBPgGz8Uy3dk"},"source":["Procedures:\n","1.
